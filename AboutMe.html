		<p>Everyone loves kettlebells. What’s not to love in swinging around an iron cannonball that has a handle attached to it? Apart from the kettlebell looking extremely cool, as well as you looking all manly and stuff while training with it, it is also a highly effective training tool. After all, it is something that Russian powerlifters and wrestlers have been using for three centuries now. And there is one exercise that you can do with a kettlebell, that’s pretty much the only one you’ll ever need, particularly as a grappler. In that sense, let’s look at how a Turkish Get Up workout for grappling can help you with your performance on the mats.

The Turkish get up is a complicated training exercise that requires a lot of dexterity, spatial orientation, coordination, strength, etc. In short, it is not an easy one to perform, and might even be dangerous if you do not know what you are doing. You will be holding a heavy iron ball over your head while performing it, so this comes as no surprise. As afar as an effective workout for grappling goes, just mastering the Turkish get up is more than enough. However, today we’ll go a bit further, and provide you with a Turkish get up workout that will challenge even the strongest among us.</p>

<p>The Turkish Get Up
As an exercise, the Turklsih get up dates back (most likely) to ancient times when Truskish wrestlers were preparing for competitions. What they’ used as weight is anybody’s guess, but combined with the Russian kettlebell we have the exercise we all love to hate today. Seriously, the Turkish get up is the Tabata of kettlebell exercises. it is extremely effective and rewarding, but nobody really loves doing them for prolonged periods of time.

<h2>Turkish Get Up Workout For Grappling</h2> 
<br>
 The exercise is basically taking you through all levels of motion while keeping your entire body engaged. The focus of engagement is on the core at all times and other body parts get activated throughout the motion at different stages.

<h3>The Turkish</h3> get up starts with you lying on your back. you only need one kettlebell, which you hold in one arm and simply bench press it. From there on, your arm stays straight until you’re in the same position again. <br>
The first step is lifting your body up, while propping on your gree hand. First, you go with the elbow and then the palm. The next step is usually hard for people that don’t grapple, but it’ll come easy to Jiu-Jiteros. It is a technical stand up. However, you can’t just swing your leg back.
<br>

It is more than enough to just get on the knee of your back leg. From there on you can focus on getting up to standing, with perfect posture. At all times, the kettlebell stays above you, meaning you’re now in a position where you’re holding a kettlebell with one arm straight over your head. And that’s just halfway through – you now need to go back to prone the same way you came up.</p>
